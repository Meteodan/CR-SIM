Get the latest version of the Fortran CR-SIM release. The source file is named 
crsim_[release version].tar.gz. The following steps are required to install,
compile and run the CR-SIM software on a Linux platform:

1.	Unpack the model by typing the following:

        tar –zxvf crsim_[release version].tar.gz

2.	Go to the top level directory of the newly created crsim_[release version]

3.	Configure the build by defining following:

	NETCDF=<netcdf4_library_location>
	NETCDF_FORTRAN=<netcdf_fortran_library_location>
	NCCMP=<NCCMP_library_location>
	INSTDIR=<installation_directory>

         and run the configure script as follows:

	./configure --with-netcdf=$NETCDF --with-netcdf-fortran=$NETCDF_FORTRAN 
                      –with-nccmp=$NCCMP --prefix=$INSTDIR 

	 A sample call is as follows:

	./configure --with-netcdf=/storage2/starbuck/packages/netcdf 
                    --with-netcdf_fortran=/storage2/starbuck/packages/netcdf 
                     --with-nccmp=/usr/local/bin --prefix=/storage2/starbuck/itest

	Note that the NCCMP is not a mandatory library. If this library is not found 
        (either on the system or on the specified path), the configure script will 
        issue a warning saying that one or more tests will fail because the comparison
        between the reference output data sets and the output created on your system
        during the test runs will not be possible.


4.	Possible options when invoking “configure” 

	--disable-openmp
	The OpenMPI library is mandatory for CR-SIM and it is enabled by default.  
	The configure scripts will verify it and stop configuration if this library is 
        not found on your system.  However, user can reject OpenMPI support and run the 
        code serially by specifying the option “--disable-openmp” when invoking “configure”.

	--without-preloadlut
	The default compilation flag is “__PRELOAD_LUT__” which accelerates the code by 
        loading all the scattering lookup tables (LUTs) in memory before the main computation
        part and is supported with OpenMPI.  However, user can disable this flag in 
        configuration time by specifying the option “--without-preloadlut”.  

	This option should be specified in following situations:
	(1)	there is a concern that there is not enough memory in user system to store
                the LUT data
	(2)	if the configuration options MP_PHYSICS=20,MP_PHYSICS=50 or MP_PHYSICS=70
                are planned to be used when executing the CR-SIM, and this because 
                the OpenMPI has not yet been implemented for those two options.  

	If “--without-preloadlut” is specified when invoking “configure”, the option
                 “--disable-openmp”  has also to be specified. If not, the configure script
                  will report an error and stop configuration. 

5.	Build the executable by typing 
	make

6.	Check the build with:
	make check

7.	Install the software in the directory specified by “--prefix” argument:
	make install

	This will install the following:
	- Executable crsim in the bin directory:
	  <installation_directory>/bin/crsim

	- Configuration file in the etc directory:
	  <installation_directory>/etc/ PARAMETERS

	- Software license,  README file and INSTALL.txt  will be produced in 
          share/crsim/ directory
	  <installation_directory>/share/crsim/LICENSE
	  <installation_directory>/share/crsim/README
          <installation_directory>/share/crsim/INSTALL.txt
	
	- CRSIM Software User Manual in share/doc/crsim/ directory:
	  <installation_directory>/share/doc/crsim/crsim_*pdf
	
	- Auxiliary data (contained in the directories LLUTS3, P3 and SBM_20) in
          the share/crsim/aux/ directory:
          <installation_directory>/share/crsim/aux/LLUTS3/
          <installation_directory>/share/crsim/aux/P3/
          <installation_directory>/share/crsim/aux/SBM_20/


	- Test data, test scripts and test configuration files in the share/crsim/test
           directory:
	  <installation_directory>/share/crsim/test/


8.	Run the tests using the executable and input/output data files from the directory
        specified by “--prefix” argument
	make installcheck


	EXECUTION

 The general convention for invoking a model is via a command shell. The general format
 of the calling command is as follows:

	./crsim ConfigurationFile WRFInputFile,WRFmpInputFile OutFile

 where “crsim” is the name of executable,  WRFInputFile,WRFmpInputFile are the  required
 input files and the OutFile is the name of the main output file. 

 Please note that the WRFmpInputFile is the mandatory input only when configuration parameters
  MP_PHYSICS is equal to 20 or 40; in all other cases the execution can be simply invoked with:

	./crsim ConfigurationFile WRFInputFile OutFile

 where it is implicitly assumed that the content of WRFInputFile is identical to content of
 WRFmpInputFile, so duplication of files in the command line is avoided.

  For more details about the Configuration and I/O parameters, please see Section 3 of the
  CR-SIM User Manual.
