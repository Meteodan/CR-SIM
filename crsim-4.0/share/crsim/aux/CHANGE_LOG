Mar    2024: updated the ASCII files for  MP_PHYSICS=20: SBM_20/ to increase the number of bins to 43

Nov    2018: added the look up tables for snow_ar.0.6 for densities of 10 and 50 kg m-3 

Mar 17 2018: added the look up tables for all graupel categories for density of 0.5 gr cm-3

Mar 15 2018: added required ASCII files for  MP_PHYSICS=20: SBM_20/ containing inofrmation about bin
             densities, masses, radii and terminal velocities.

Mar 15 2018: added the look up table for ice PSD parameters for P3 microphysics scheme (MP_PHYSICS=50): P3/

May 18 2017: calculated LUT for small ice

Apr 29 2016: added LLUTS3/mpl/ data files containing the extinction and backscattering cross sections for ice spheres,
             at densities ranging from 0.1 to 0.93 gr/cm^3 and for frequencies of 353 nm and 532 nm. The used code
             for electromagnetic scattering by a single homogenous sphere is the 'BHMIE' created by
             Craig F., Bohren and Donald Ronald Huffman  1983, and available at:
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codes_for_electromagnetic_scattering_by_spheres#Codes_for_electromagnetic_scattering_by_a_single_homogeneous_sphere.
             Ice particles are assumed to be ice-air mixtures whose refractive index is computed by using Maxwell-Garnett mixing formula. 

Feb 16 2016: added LLUTS3/ceilo/cld_ceilo_905nm_p25.dat data file containing the extinction and
             backscattering cross sections for spherical particles at 905 nm. The used code 
             for electromagnetic scattering by a single homogenous sphere is the 'BHMIE' created by
             Craig F., Bohren and Donald Ronald Huffman  1983, and available at:

Sep 15 2015: change of the filenames of the ice species (ice_ar0.20 and ice_ar0.90) for 5 GHz:
             the frequency string in the name "fr05.0GHz" is replaced with "fr05.5GHz" for the 
             sake of consistency 


May 01 2015: the first version of LLUTS3 released
